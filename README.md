# CLI PYTHON WHATSAPP SCHEDULER
Python CLI project that takes a few inputs from users; to write their message, include the recipient's phone number, the date and time you want the message sent and once the time reaches it automatically sends the message.

## TASK DESCRIPTION
### WhatsApp Message Scheduler:

Build a CLI app to schedule whatsapp messages and send them automatically once the scheduled time has passed. For example, your app should prompt the user to write a message, their whatsapp number, the recipientâ€™s number and the time they intend to have it sent out. You can save this data on an SQLite Database.

## Why Schedule Whatsapp messages?
From sending messages to people before you forget what you wanted to tell them to wishing your loved ones messages such as "Happy Birthday" and "Happy Anniversary" when the day arrives or even for businesses sending their customers important messages during working hours, scheduling saves you from the hassle of remembering and remembers for you. All you have to do is set the message, the recipient's number and the time and yout message will be delivered at that time.
